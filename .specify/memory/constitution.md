# SNAPs Specification Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First Development
Every SNAP implementation must adhere strictly to the SNAPs specification.
The specification defines the contract for composability, ensuring that any
SNAP can be combined atomically with any other SNAP regardless of language
or implementation details. Documentation must clearly indicate specification
version compliance and any deviations must be explicitly noted.

### II. Transaction Composability
All SNAPs MUST expose operations as transaction functions that accept
external FoundationDB transactions. This enables the fundamental promise
of SNAPs: multiple operations across different layers executing as a
single atomic unit. No SNAP may manage its own transaction lifecycle
when composed with others.

### III. Namespace Isolation via Directories
SNAPs MUST use FoundationDB's Directory layer exclusively - never raw keys.
This ensures complete namespace isolation between SNAPs and enables safe
multi-tenancy. Each SNAP operates within its assigned directory subspace,
preventing key collisions and maintaining clear boundaries between components.

### IV. Language-Agnostic Interoperability
While implementations should be idiomatic to each language, data formats
and protocols MUST be language-agnostic. A SNAP written in Java must be
able to read data written by a SNAP in Python. This requires careful
consideration of serialization formats, byte ordering, and encoding standards.

### V. Minimal Dependencies
SNAPs MUST depend only on FoundationDB and essential APIs (logging,
telemetry, serialization). Framework lock-in is explicitly forbidden.
This ensures SNAPs remain composable across different application
architectures and don't force adopters into specific technology stacks.

### VI. Multi-Tenancy by Design
SNAPs MUST support concurrent access by multiple tenants through directory
prefixing. Isolation between tenants must be complete - no shared state,
no cross-tenant data leakage, and no performance interference. This is
not optional; it's fundamental to the SNAP architecture.

## Quality Standards

### Documentation Requirements
- Every SNAP must include comprehensive API documentation
- Usage examples demonstrating transaction composition
- Performance characteristics and limitations
- Migration guides for version upgrades
- Clear specification version compatibility matrix

### Testing Discipline
- Unit tests for all public APIs
- Integration tests demonstrating multi-SNAP transactions
- Deterministic simulation tests where applicable
- Performance benchmarks with documented baselines
- Multi-tenancy isolation verification tests

### Versioning Standards
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) is mandatory
- MAJOR changes indicate specification incompatibility
- MINOR changes add functionality while maintaining compatibility
- PATCH changes are bug fixes with no API changes
- Breaking changes require migration documentation

## Website Catalogue Standards

### SNAP Submission Requirements
All SNAPs submitted to the catalogue must:
- Be hosted in a public repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Include a compliant README with specification version
- Provide working examples of transaction composition
- Document language requirements and dependencies
- Include license information (OSS preferred)

### Catalogue Entry Format
Each catalogue entry must specify:
- SNAP name and description
- Category (Queue, Blob Store, Search, etc.)
- Supported languages with version requirements
- FoundationDB version compatibility
- Link to repository and documentation
- Maintainer contact information

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitution amendments require:
1. Proposal via GitHub issue with rationale
2. Community discussion period (minimum 7 days)
3. Implementation proof-of-concept if adding requirements
4. Maintainer approval and version increment

### Specification Evolution
The SNAPs specification evolves through:
- RFC process for major changes
- Community input via issues and discussions
- Backward compatibility as a priority
- Clear deprecation timelines for breaking changes

### Compliance Verification
- All catalogue submissions reviewed for specification compliance
- Automated checks for required documentation elements
- Community reporting of non-compliant implementations
- Grace periods for addressing compliance issues
