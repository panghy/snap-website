# Feature Specification: GitLab.com Repository Support

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-support-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add support for linking to gitlab.com repos (pulling the same data as github repos)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a SNAP developer or maintainer, I want to add my GitLab-hosted SNAP implementations to the SNAP catalogue so that other developers can discover and use my SNAPs, regardless of whether my repository is hosted on GitHub or GitLab.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing the SNAP catalogue, **When** they see a SNAP entry with a GitLab repository URL, **Then** the entry displays the same repository metadata as GitHub entries (repository name, stars, description, language indicators)

2. **Given** a SNAP maintainer wants to add their GitLab-hosted SNAP, **When** they provide a gitlab.com repository URL in the catalogue entry, **Then** the system accepts and validates the GitLab URL format

3. **Given** a catalogue entry links to a GitLab repository, **When** a user clicks on the repository link, **Then** they are directed to the correct GitLab repository page

4. **Given** the system needs to display repository information, **When** fetching data from a GitLab repository, **Then** the system retrieves and displays the same types of metadata as it does for GitHub repositories

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a GitLab repository URL is malformed or invalid?
- How does the system handle private GitLab repositories?
- What happens if GitLab.com is unavailable when fetching repository data?
- How does the system handle GitLab repositories that have been deleted or moved?
- What happens when mixing GitHub and GitLab repositories in the same SNAP entry for multi-language implementations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept gitlab.com repository URLs in the same contexts where github.com URLs are currently accepted
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate GitLab repository URLs to ensure they follow the gitlab.com URL format
- **FR-003**: System MUST display GitLab repository links with appropriate visual indication (e.g., GitLab icon or label)
- **FR-004**: System MUST retrieve and display the following repository metadata from GitLab: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact metadata fields not specified - should match GitHub fields like stars, description, primary language, last updated?]
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to click GitLab repository links to navigate to the external GitLab repository page
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle both GitHub and GitLab repository URLs within the same SNAP catalogue entry
- **FR-007**: System MUST gracefully handle failures when fetching GitLab repository data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: fallback behavior not specified - show cached data, error message, or omit metadata?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST treat GitLab and GitHub repositories equally in terms of display prominence and functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST support GitLab repository URLs for all language implementations listed in a SNAP entry
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication requirements for GitLab API access - public access only or support for authenticated requests?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: caching strategy for GitLab repository data - same as GitHub?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rate limiting handling for GitLab API - what are the limits and fallback behavior?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Repository Entry**: Represents a link to either a GitHub or GitLab repository, containing URL, platform type, and associated metadata
- **Repository Metadata**: Information fetched from the repository platform including stars, description, primary language, last update time, and other relevant statistics
- **SNAP Catalogue Entry**: The existing entity that will now support multiple repository platforms instead of GitHub-only
