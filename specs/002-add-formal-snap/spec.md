# Feature Specification: Add Formal SNAP Specification

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-formal-snap`
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add formal SNAP specification to the snap-website (this repo)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or architect interested in the SNAP ecosystem, I want to access and read the formal SNAP specification directly on the website, so that I can understand the complete technical requirements, interface definitions, and implementation guidelines for creating SNAP-compliant components without navigating to external documentation sites.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the SNAPs website, **When** they click on the "Specification" link in the navigation, **Then** they are taken to a dedicated page displaying the complete formal SNAP specification
2. **Given** a user is viewing the specification page, **When** they scroll through the content, **Then** they can see all sections including terminology, requirements, interfaces, and compliance criteria
3. **Given** a user is reading the specification, **When** they click on a table of contents item, **Then** they are smoothly scrolled to that section of the document
4. **Given** a user is on mobile device, **When** they access the specification page, **Then** the content is properly formatted and readable on their screen
5. **Given** a developer wants to implement a SNAP, **When** they review the specification, **Then** they find clear requirements for compliance and implementation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the specification content is very long? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be pagination, lazy loading, or single page scroll?]
- How does system handle printing or PDF export of the specification? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is print/export functionality required?]
- What happens if specification needs to include diagrams or code examples? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What types of media should be supported?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dedicated page for displaying the formal SNAP specification
- **FR-002**: System MUST make the specification accessible via the "Specification" navigation link that currently exists but is not functional
- **FR-003**: The specification page MUST display the complete formal SNAP specification document content
- **FR-004**: The specification MUST include a navigable table of contents for easy access to different sections
- **FR-005**: The specification content MUST be readable and properly formatted on desktop and mobile devices
- **FR-006**: The specification page MUST maintain consistent styling with the rest of the website
- **FR-007**: The specification MUST include all essential sections [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the required sections - overview, terminology, interfaces, compliance criteria, examples?]
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to access the specification without authentication or registration
- **FR-009**: The specification page MUST load within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is acceptable load time - 3 seconds, 5 seconds?]
- **FR-010**: The specification content MUST be searchable using browser's built-in search functionality (Ctrl+F/Cmd+F)
- **FR-011**: The specification MUST clearly indicate version information [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should versioning be displayed and managed?]
- **FR-012**: Internal links within the specification MUST navigate to the correct sections
- **FR-013**: The specification page MUST be accessible via direct URL for sharing and bookmarking

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Specification Document**: The formal SNAP specification content including all sections, requirements, and guidelines
- **Specification Section**: Individual parts of the specification (e.g., Overview, Terminology, Interfaces, Compliance) that can be navigated to directly
- **Table of Contents**: Navigation structure showing the hierarchy and organization of specification sections
